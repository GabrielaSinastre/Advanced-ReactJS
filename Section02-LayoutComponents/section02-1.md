# Design Patterns: Layout Components

## What are design patterns
- Effective solutions for commom challenges
  -> Effective because not all solutions are created equal, some approaches may lead to brittle code, decreased performance and reduced memory usage maintainability commonly referred to as anti-patterns.
  -> Design patterns, on the other hand, represent the most optimal and effective solutions to those challenges.

- The patterns will we cover are specific to react and have emerged from the autor personal experience working on several React applications.
  -> Design patterns that are specific to React and have emerged from personal experience and industry best practices.
  -> Best practices for managing form state
  -> Functional programming in the context of ReactJS.

- For instance, explore how to create reausable layouts for organizing components, including split screens and modals.

- Issue of reusing complex logic among components instead of duplicating code.

- How to efficiently share code responsible for tasks like fetching data from a server.

- Working with forms in React
  -> Despite the abundance of articles on the topic, handling forms can still be challenging
  -> Dive into best practices for managing form, mistakes, validation and submission in React.

- Incorporat concepts from functional programming into our React applications.
 -> Can enhance code, organization and maintainability.
 -> How functional programming concepts like Recursive can be integrated seamlessly into React development.

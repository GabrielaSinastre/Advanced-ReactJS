# Design Patterns: Functional Programming in React

## Introduction
- Is an approach to organizing code that emphasizes minimizing mutation and state change, utilizing pure functions independent of external data and treating functions as first class citizens.
- Allow us to manage component state by passing the necessary props

*Functional programming Use-cases*
- Controlled Components
- Functional Components
- HOCs
- Recursive Components
- Partial Components
- Composition

- Unlike class components wich have been in React for some time, functional components embody the functional programming paradigm, offering a concise and straightforward way to define the components.
- Three additional design patterns: Recursive Components, Partial Components and Components Composition.
